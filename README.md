### Translating a Lesson

1. Each of the languages has a folder in root of this repo. To start translating you need to copy a file from the English language to the corresponding folder in your language and start translating.

2. Translated lessons must include page metadata.
   * `title` should be a translation of the original lesson's `title`.
   * `version` should be set to the original English `version`.

   For example `/ja/lessons/basics/basics.md`:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: 基本
  version: 1.0.0
  ---
  ```
